# Willow_Test
1) Descriptions:
	The automated test script Normalizer_test.py uses python unittest to verify 
	that the functions in the script normalizer.py work as expected.

2) Environment requirements:
	a) The automated test script was developed and tested under Python 3.9, but it should work with Python 3.x
	b) Normalizer_test.py needs the same Python libraries that normalizer.py uses.

3) Build and execute:
	Download from GitHub the normalizer.py, Normalizer_test, and the sample test data test_worksheet.csv into the same 
	local directory on your computer. In the same GitHub repository, an execution screenshot is included.
	
	go to the above directory from the command line, enter 'python -m unittest -v Normalizer_test'.
	You should see a result similar to the Screenshot.JPG included in the folder.
